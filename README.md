# PBRify

## This repository is no longer maintained. If you still want to try it out, you should know that this program uses a UI library that now requires a membership. Unless you're willing to pay for a PySimpleGUI license or rewrite the program, I'm afraid this is no longer usable.

Generate a PBR version of any minecraft resource pack.

Takes longer depending on the resource pack resolution, expect a couple of minutes.

## What's comming next

An interface to edit specular color association for specific blocks.
A normal / height map edge smoother to avoid blocks repeating patern near the edges.
